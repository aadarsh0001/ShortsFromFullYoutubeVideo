🎯 FINAL GOAL (What You’re Building)

A local desktop/web app that:

Takes a long video

Finds important moments

Cuts them into short clips

Adds subtitles

Auto-formats for Shorts / Reels / TikTok

Lets you manually tweak clips

Basically: Your own Vizard AI

🧠 TECH STACK (100% FREE)
Core Tools

VS Code (you already have it ✅)

Python (main AI + video logic)

FFmpeg (video cutting & processing)

Whisper (OpenAI open-source) – subtitles & transcription

PyTorch – AI models

React OR simple HTML/CSS/JS – frontend

FastAPI – backend API

All free. No paid license.

🛣️ FULL ROADMAP (STEP BY STEP)
🔹 PHASE 1: Foundations (Must Do First)
1️⃣ Install Essentials

You need:

Python 3.10+

FFmpeg

Git

Why?

Python = AI brain

FFmpeg = video cutting

Git = version control (VERY important)

2️⃣ Learn These Basics (No skipping)

You don’t need to be an expert:

Python basics

How FFmpeg cuts videos

How AI models are loaded (PyTorch)

Basic frontend (buttons, file upload)

⏱️ Time: ~1–2 weeks

🔹 PHASE 2: Core Video Engine
3️⃣ Video Upload & Processing

Build a script that:

Takes a video file

Extracts audio

Saves metadata (duration, fps)

Tools:

FFmpeg

Python subprocess

This is your video pipeline.

4️⃣ Speech-to-Text (Subtitles)

Use:

Whisper (open-source)

What it gives you:

Full transcript

Timestamps per sentence

Language detection

This is the brain of your app.

🔹 PHASE 3: AI That Finds “Good Moments”
5️⃣ Highlight Detection (Very Important)

You’ll detect clip-worthy moments using:

Sentence length

Speech energy

Keyword importance

Silence gaps

Emotion score (optional)

Simple logic example:

Long pause → clip boundary

High energy speech → highlight

Keywords like “important”, “best”, “top” → priority

You DON’T need advanced AI at first.

6️⃣ Clip Generator

Automatically:

Select timestamps

Cut 15–60 sec clips

Export multiple clips

FFmpeg does all the cutting.

🔹 PHASE 4: Vizard-Like Features
7️⃣ Auto Subtitles on Video

Burn subtitles into video

Style them (font, size, color)

Optional:

Animated subtitles later

8️⃣ Auto Resize (Shorts / Reels)

Use FFmpeg to:

Convert landscape → vertical (9:16)

Auto-center speaker

Blur background if needed

9️⃣ Speaker Detection (Advanced but Free)

Use face detection models

Track speaker position

Crop video dynamically

This is how Vizard auto-frames speakers.

🔹 PHASE 5: User Interface
🔟 Simple UI (Start Small)

Options:

Local web app (best)

Desktop app (later)

Features:

Upload video

Preview clips

Download clips

Toggle subtitles

Choose aspect ratio

Don’t overdesign. Simple works.

🔹 PHASE 6: Quality & Automation
1️⃣1️⃣ Smart Clip Ranking

Rank clips by:

Engagement score

Energy

Length

Keyword density

Show “Top Clips” first.

1️⃣2️⃣ Batch Processing

Let it:

Process overnight

Generate 20–50 clips automatically

🔹 PHASE 7: Optimization (Optional but Powerful)

GPU acceleration (if you have one)

Faster Whisper models

Cache transcripts

Background processing
