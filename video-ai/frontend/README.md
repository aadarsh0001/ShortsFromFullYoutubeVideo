# Frontend Application Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains the frontend application for the video processing project. The frontend is responsible for providing a user interface that allows users to upload videos, preview clips, and manage subtitles.

## File Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that structures the user interface.
- **style.css**: Contains styles for the frontend application, defining the layout and appearance of UI components.
- **app.js**: The JavaScript file that handles user interactions and communicates with the backend API.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Open the Project**: Use a code editor to open the `frontend` directory.
2. **Run a Local Server**: To view the application, you can use a local server. You can use tools like Live Server in VS Code or any other local server setup.
3. **Access the Application**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:PORT` (replace PORT with the port number your server is running on).

## Usage

- **Upload Video**: Use the upload button to select a video file from your local machine.
- **Preview Clips**: After processing, you can preview the generated clips.
- **Manage Subtitles**: Toggle subtitles on or off and choose the desired aspect ratio for the output.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement additional features for user customization.
- Improve the user interface for better usability.
- Add error handling and user feedback mechanisms.
